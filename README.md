# Caesar Encryption and OTP Encryption

## Brian Burciaga T00566000
## Desmond

The purpose of this lab is to understand encryption and decryption
with Caesar Algorithm and OTP. 


## What was completed

- Encryption with Caesar would loop back to a if it went outside
the extent of the alphabetical letters
- It would assign all letters lowercase values
- Able to decrypt with Caesar key
- Able to decrypt with Brute Force method
- Encryption with OTP
- Decryption with OTP
- Key generated from `od /dev/random`

## What was not completed

- Unable to narrow down the answer for brute force. Only able to 
print out all possible keys and decryptions from 0 to 26

## What would we change about the assignment

If given the extra time we would implement looping characters A-Z.
As well as see what would happen if we were to loop over integers.
